# Combination-based DFS

## subsets
Given a set of distinct integers, return all possible subsets.
```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums):
        nums = sorted(nums) # only sort if we need output of ascending order
        combinations = []
        self.dfs(nums, 0, [], combinations)
        return combinations
    
    def dfs(self, nums, index, combination, combinations):
        combinations.append(list(combination))

        for i in range(index, len(nums)):
            combination.append(nums[i])
            self.dfs(nums, i+1, combination, combinations)
            combination.pop() # backtracking
```
The DFS will build a tree with each node representing a subset.

e.g. [1,2,3]
```
          []
      /   |   \
   [1]   [2]  [3]
  /  \     \
[1,2] [1,3] [2,3]
  |
[1,2,3]
```
follow-up: what if nums contain duplicate numbers?

Then we must sort nums, and add a condition in dfs, that is when the next number is the same as previous one, we need skip the next dfs since we don't want pass the same current combination to the next dfs, otherwise, this would cause duplicate subsets where nums are the same but in different order.
